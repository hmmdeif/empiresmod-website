After a brief slowdown back in September, we’ve made huge amounts of progress in November, and even hit a major game development milestone… Empires UE4 is playable from start to finish! That’s right, you can hop into a game, play it, and then once a victory condition is achieved, the match ends and the server goes to the next map.
Building the game loop was a huge part of the current milestone, and we are in the final stretch of closing out Milestone 2.</description></item><item><title>Squads and Weapons Progress</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-september-october-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-september-october-2020/</guid><description>Project Update Roy Awesome Hey everyone! Combined update for September and October this month. Due to the nature of the all-volunteer team and a number of us having day jobs, we ran into some issues getting an update out last month. However, progress continues and we’ve had a lot of discussion for the post 1.0 future of this project.
We are working on a new website, one that will allow us to post updates more frequently and support the growing project (and maybe finally fix https too).</description></item><item><title>Chat, Recoil, and Weapons</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-august-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-august-2020/</guid><description>Project Update Roy Awesome Hey Everyone
This month I have the absolute pleasure to announce that we have completed the first development milestone for the Empires UE4 project. This milestone completion is a major achievement for this team, and is now the furthest any Empires remake has ever gotten in nearly 15 years. While we have quite a ways to go until this project is playable and fun, I am very proud of this team and the progress they have made in these last 3 short months.</description></item><item><title>Glycen City and Players</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-july-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-july-2020/</guid><description>Project Update Roy Awesome Hey Everyone! Another month in the bag for UE4 and we’ve really kicked some butt. We achieved a major milestone this month, we have held multiple playtests! That’s right, we’ve started to be able to play the game and get a general gameplay loop going. We even found a crash while testing!

This is a large milestone because it has a feeling of making this project real.</description></item><item><title>Music and Damage Progress</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-june-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-june-2020/</guid><description>Project Update Roy Awesome Our second full month is complete working on the Empires UE4 port. We have made some very appreciable progress toward completing the Minimum Viable milestone, and we will soon be able to check that one off.
June was a bit slower than May, mostly due to many of our team members returning to work and the reality of life during COVID settling in. As a volunteer, free time project, we are at the whims of real life obligations to make progress, and while this month’s update is shorter than last, we still made an insane amount of progress.</description></item><item><title>Unreal Port - The Intro</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-may-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/unreal-progress-report-may-2020/</guid><description>Hello Everyone! I am incredibly excited to announce that we are porting Empires to the Unreal Engine! This project has been going on for the better part of the month, and we are making extremely good progress. We have brought together a great team and while we are only working nights and weekends on this project, I hope that you can all see how fast we are progressing and how exciting it is for Empires to have a future on a game engine that lets the game excel.</description></item></channel></rss>
