Another month in the bag for UE4 and we’ve really kicked some butt. We achieved a major milestone this month, we have held multiple playtests! That’s right, we’ve started to be able to play the game and get a general gameplay loop going. We even found a crash while testing!
This is a large milestone because it has a feeling of making this project real.</description></item><item><title>Empires UE4 Monthly Update - June 2020</title><link>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/2020-07-04-unreal-progress-report-june-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.empiresmod.com/posts/2020-07-04-unreal-progress-report-june-2020/</guid><description>Project Update - Roy Awesome Our second full month is complete working on the Empires UE4 port. We have made some very appreciable progress toward completing the Minimum Viable milestone, and we will soon be able to check that one off.
June was a bit slower than May, mostly due to many of our team members returning to work and the reality of life during COVID settling in. As a volunteer, free time project, we are at the whims of real life obligations to make progress, and while this month’s update is shorter than last, we still made an insane amount of progress.</description></item></channel></rss>
