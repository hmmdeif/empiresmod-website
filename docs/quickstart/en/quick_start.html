			<p>
				<strong>1.</strong> The first thing you see when you join a server is the <strong>Message Of The Day</strong>. It often shows rules about that specific server, so read up and close it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.</strong> <span lang="en-gb">The s</span>econd window that pops up is the <strong>Team Selection Screen</strong>. Click Auto-Assign to be assigned to the team with the fewest players.

				<strong>3.</strong> After choosing a team you will be presented with the <strong>Class Selection Screen</strong>.
				<span lang="en-gb">The default selection is the Engineer</span>. An Engineer can do everything you need early in the game, so you'll be prepared for anything that hits you.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong><u>HINT:</u></strong> Weapon slots with a <span lang="en-gb">
			number in the top right corner can be clicked on to select from a

			<img src="../pictures/minimap.png" alt="minimap screen"/><br/>
			<span class="comment">2. Your Minimap.</span>
			</div>
			<p>			
				<strong>2.</strong> The <strong>upper-right corner</strong> shows information about how many resources and reinforcements the team has available.
				<ul>
				<li>Reinforcements (a.k.a. "<strong>Tickets</strong>") show how many times your team (and the other team) can spawn.</li>
				<li><strong>Vehicles</strong> on the battlefield.</li>
				<li><strong>Wages</strong> - Personal Cash.</li>
				<li><strong>Resources</strong> - Team Cash.</li>
				<li><strong>Res/Sec</strong> - How much Resources your team makes per second.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>2.</strong> The <strong>minimap</strong> gives an overhead view of the whole map. You can zoom in and out using the zoom keys <strong>(<span lang="en-gb">'</span>[<span lang="en-gb">'</span> and 
				<span lang="en-gb">'</span>]<span lang="en-gb">'</span> by default)</strong>.

				On the minimap, Brenodi Empire units are always blue and Northern Faction units are always red.
				<ul>
				<li>The Commander is shown as a <strong>camera<span lang="en-gb"> 
				cross</span> icon</strong>. If your team has a commander, his name will be shown in the <strong>top left corner</strong> of the screen.
					<li><span lang="en-gb"><strong>Revive Engineers</strong> are

				<strong>3.</strong> The lower-left corner displays your <strong>Health</strong> and <strong>Stamina</strong>. Your <strong>Health</strong> will go down when you take damage and can be replenished by <strong>Health crates</strong> or Engineers using the <strong>Engineer Tool</strong> on you. <strong>Stamina</strong>, 
				used when jumping and sprinting, always regenerates over time.&nbsp; 
				If you completely run out of stamina, it will not regenerate for 
				a few secon<span lang="en-gb">ds</span>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>4.</strong> The lower-right corner shows your <strong>ammo counter</strong>. The line of bullets represents the amount of ammo remaining in your current magazine. The number to the right is the remaining ammo you have.

				The <strong>Commander</strong> can give you direct <strong>orders</strong>. These allow the commander to easily direct his soldiers to where they will help the team the most.<br/><br/>When you are given an order it will appear on your screen as either:
				<ul>
				<li>a <strong>green pentagon (for move and guard orders)</strong>, or</li>
				<li>a <strong>red diamond (for attack orders)</strong>. The attack order diamond will follow the unit that you are ordered to attack, giving you both direction and a tactical advantage.</li>
				</ul>
				When you are given an order you will hear an instruction and one 
			of these shapes will appear on your HUD. If you are not looking at 
			the objective the shape will appear on the side or bottom of your 
			screen, telling you in which direction you must look to locate it.

			<h3>Ingame Interaction</h3>	
			<img src="../pictures/nf_crates.jpg" border="1" alt='Northern Faction Crates' style="float:right"><img src="../pictures/imp_crates.jpg" border="1" alt='Imperial Crates'><br/>
			<span class="comment" style="float:right">Northern Faction Crates.</span><span class="comment">Brenodi Empire Crates.</span>
			<p>
				Located in Armories, placed by Engineers, and<span lang="en-gb"> 
				sometimes</span> scattered around maps are supply crates. They come in two flavors: 
				<span lang="en-gb">A</span>mmo (the Engineer crate falls under this) and Health. To use one of these crates hold down the 
				<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>USE<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span> key <strong>(<span lang="en-gb">'</span>E<span lang="en-gb">'</span> by default)</strong> when near the crate and looking at it.<br/><br/>Similar to crates are the vehicle factory consoles. To access one, move in front of it and then press the 
				<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>USE<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span> key.
			</p>
			<p>
				Empires has many different vehicles. To enter a vehicle, simply go up to it and press the 
				<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>USE<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span> key. You can switch positions inside the vehicle by using the function keys <strong>(F1, F2, F3, etc)</strong>. The F1 position is always the driver position. Pressing the 
				<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>USE<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span> key again will exit the vehicle.
				<span lang="en-gb"><strong>DO NOT </strong>drive vehicles that 
				other players may be using. Instead, build your own at a Vehicle 
				Factory.</span></p>
			<h4>Section II: Playing The Game</h4>
			<p class="unique">In Empires, <strong>TEAMWORK IS KEY. </strong>Go in alone and you'll take out two or three guys, go in with your teammates and you'll take out an entire forward base.</p>
			<h3>The Basics</h3>
			<p>Basically, every game of Empires goes like this:
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Move out right away</strong> to where your teammates are defending or attacking. If the game just started, listen to your <strong>Commander</strong>'s strategy.</li>
			<li><strong>Capture and defend your resource nodes</strong> so your 
			team gets <span lang="en-gb">resources.</span></li>
			<li><strong>Attack the enemy's resource nodes</strong> to cripple their 
			<span lang="en-gb">economy</span>.</li>
			<li><strong><span lang="en-gb">Seize </span>enemy outposts</strong> and push towards their main base.</li>
			<li><strong>Kill the enemy Command Vehicle</strong> or <strong>deplete all enemy tickets</strong> 
			and kill all enemies <span lang="en-gb">that are </span>still alive.</li>
			<li>If both teams have depleted their tickets, the game starts a 5-minute count<span lang="en-gb">down</span>. When finished, the game goes into <strong>Sudden Death</strong>. Both Command Vehicles will now die from a single hit from any explosive.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			These are the basic steps in <strong>Classic</strong> gameplay. There is also <strong>Conquest</strong> gameplay, which is usually a map with Infantry and Tanks, but no Commander. Then there's <strong>Mission</strong> gameplay, where one team has a set goal they must achieve, usually in a set time period. <strong>Conquest</strong> and <strong>Mission</strong> maps often use <strong>Flags</strong> as spawnpoints.
			</p>
			<h3>Infantry Tips</h3>
			<div style="float:right;margin-left:7px;margin-bottom:7px;">
			<img src="../pictures/screenshot1.jpg" border="1"/><br clear="all"/>
			<span class="comment"><em>"I find your lack of faith... disturbing."</em></span>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>General infantry tips:
			<ul>
			<li><strong>You can choose a spawnpoint</strong> from the spawn map, <strong>
			<span lang="en-gb">(</span>"Enter" by default)</strong>. Next time you die, you'll spawn there.</li>
			<li><strong>You can change Classes and Skills</strong> in a Barracks, an Armory or at a Flag by pressing <strong>"b" (by default)</strong> and selecting your new loadout. <u>Changing them anywhere else will not update them immediately.</u></li>
			<li><strong>You can get extra ammo</strong> from Engineers who drop ammo boxes or in Armories.</li>
			<li>Pressing the <strong><span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>F<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span></strong> key 
			<strong>(by default)</strong> will bring up the <strong>popup menu</strong>. You can use the mouse or the keys shown inside the brackets to select different menus.</li>
			<li><strong>Guns do not damage tanks or buildings<span lang="en-gb"> 
			(including turrets)</span>.</strong> Only explosive devices damage tanks or buildings.</li>
			<li>As a <strong>non-Engineer</strong>, you can help construct a building by holding the USE key ("E" by default).</li>
			<li><strong>Headshots</strong> do <span lang="en-gb">additional</span> damage<span lang="en-gb"> 
			depending on the weapon used</span>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="unique">An unintended 'feature' you'll see a lot is <strong>killspawning</strong>. This is where you type<span lang="en-gb"> 
			'!kill' in chat or</span> <span lang="en-gb">(</span>'kill' in the game console<span lang="en-gb">)</span>&nbsp; to spawn back at a location that is under siege. It's a very handy way of quickly moving troops around the battlefield, but be careful not to use up too many tickets.</p>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<p>General Class guidelines:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Engineer:</strong> The ultimate support class. SMG's 
				are effective against all enemies<span lang="en-gb"> and</span> 
				seismic grenades deal large amounts of damage to buildings. The 
				build tool can place buildables and ammo boxes, construct or 
				destroy buildings and vehicles, and (with the Revive skill) 
				revive fallen teammates.</li>
				<li><strong>Rifleman:</strong> Highly effective against all 
				classes, his sticky bombs can destroy tanks. Though very simple 
				in concept, the rifleman can be a killing machine in the right 
				hands. However, he is highly ineffective against buildings.</li>
				<li><strong>Grenadier:</strong> With his RPG, mortar and land 
				mines, he's the best anti-tank class. With practice, the mortar 
				can take out any target, while mines can be stacked in a pile to 
				destroy any tank.</li>
				<li><strong>Scout:</strong> Primarily used for disrupting enemy 
				assets. Can sabotage buildings to make them vulnerable and less 
				effective. His grenades disorient and weaken enemies. Hard to 
				learn, harder to master.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr/>
			<p>Engineer tips:
			<ul>
			<li>Using your <strong>Engineer Tool</strong>, you can build, repair 
			and heal friendly buildings, vehicles and players by
			<span lang="en-gb">holding fire (<strong>left-click</strong>). You 
			can also deconstruct enemy vehicles and buildings.</span></li>
			<li>With the Engineer Tool out, <strong>right-click</strong> for personal building options.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Repair Upgrade</strong> Skill is very handy in the beginning of the game.</li>
			<li>Using your <strong>Revive</strong> Skill, you can bring dead teammates back to life. Just get near their corpse and hold the left mouse button (uses up 50% energy). A <strong>revive icon</strong> will float above bodies of dead teammates.</li>
			<li><strong>Engineer grenades</strong> are good against buildings.</li>
			<li>Engineer <strong>Cameras</strong> spot infantry and <strong>Radars</strong> spot vehicles. A large yellow diamond will appear briefly around a spotted enemy.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Vehicle Tips</h3>
			<div>
			<p>General vehicle tips:
			<ul>
			<li>You can build vehicles in the <strong>Vehicle Factory.</strong> Go to the vehicle building console or press 
			<span lang="en-gb">'</span><strong>V<span lang="en-gb">'</span> (by default)</strong> when in the vehicle factory.</li>
			<li>Vehicles can be upgraded with new weapons, armors or engines 
			that are researched by the commander using a radar building. Press 
			the<span lang="en-gb"> </span><strong>&quot;CUSTOMIZE&quot; button<span lang="en-gb">
			</span></strong>to start upgrading your vehicle.<br/></li>
				<li>Vehicles can be <strong>recustomized</strong>
				<span lang="en-gb">by pressing '<strong>V' 
				(default)</strong> whilst in a vehicle on a repair pad. Ammo 
				will also be refilled whilst your vehicle is on a repair pad.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Vehicles cost resources.</strong> Don't waste them or your team may lose.</li>
				<li><strong>Vehicles can overheat if they fire too quickly.</strong> 
				<span lang="en-gb">Upgraded engines can help delay overheating.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Make sure you use the right weapon for the right job.</strong> Some weapons may be weak against infantry, but strong against tanks, and vice versa. Ask around if you need help deciding.</li>
				<li><strong>Watch out for mines.</strong> They cause a lot of 
				damage to vehicles<span lang="en-gb">. A single mine can cripple 
				a non-upgraded vehicle.</span></li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<p>
			Tips on making your vehicle:
		<ul>
		<li>Vehicles have a <strong>weight limit</strong>, shown in the lower left corner. If it goes red, you won't be able to build your vehicle.<br/><strong><u>HINT:</u> </strong>It's good practice to make the best use of the weight restrictions on your vehicle, but <strong>always choose a lot of armor over a lot of weaponry.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Don't take the biggest, newest tank</strong> if your team doesn't have a lot of resources. Two fully upgraded Medium Tanks cost the same as one fully upgraded Heavy Tank, but the two Mediums have numbers and firepower per second on their side.</li>
		<li><strong>Sometimes there are a lot of different weapons,</strong> armor, or engines you can choose to put on your vehicle. If you're not sure what type of tank you should make or how you should customize it, don't be afraid to ask your teammates for advice.</li>
		<li><span lang="en-gb"><strong>T</strong></span><strong>he</strong><span lang="en-gb">
		<strong>starting armor, engine and</strong></span><strong> weapons are 
		very weak.</strong> Use a researched armor, engine or weapons whenever 
		possible.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>If important research is nearly done, just wait until it's finished before customizing your tank.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Commander Tips</h3>
		<p>
		<strong>Commanding and Research</strong> is
		<a href="http://www.empiresmod.com/help/">explained in the full manual, 
		which is available</a> <span lang="en-gb">
		<a href="http://www.empiresmod.com/help/">h<span class="auto-style1">ere</span></a></span> or (<span lang="en-gb">alternatively</span>) in<span lang="en-gb"> 
		the </span>&nbsp;<i>Steam/steamapps/common/Empires/Manual<span lang="en-gb">
		</span></i><span lang="en-gb">folder</span>.
		</p>
		<p>But there's one thing you <strong>should</strong> know about the Commander. He's got the <strong>hardest job</strong> 
		of them all, so cut him some slack when it's not going too well.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
		That's pretty much it. Stick together, listen to your Commander and use tactics instead of only raw firepower and you'll have a great time. Enjoy your first game of <strong>Empires</strong>.
