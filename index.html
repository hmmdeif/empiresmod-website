Project Update - Roy Awesome Hey Everyone! Another month in the bag for UE4 and we’ve really kicked some butt. We achieved a major milestone this month, we have held multiple playtests! That’s right, we’ve started to be able to play the game and get a general gameplay loop going. We even found a crash while testing!
This is a large milestone because it has a feeling of making this project real.</div></main></body></html>
